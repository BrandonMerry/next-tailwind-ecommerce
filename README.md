# Ecommerce Website

A full stack web application that can - create, read, update, and delete items in a shopping cart. The items are stored on a Mongodb server and the cart items are linked to the user acctounts.

**Link to project:**

<!-- ![alt tag]() need to add a photo link here  -->

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, TailwindCSS, JavaScript, NextJs,

This project uses Tailwind css for styling and NextJS as the react framework. ** I will add more, but the mvp is still in progress\***

<!-- Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold. -->

## Optimizations

-Add more menu items to navbar and link them to the correct page (about, services, team, ect...)
-move Dark mode tab to the other side of the menu items
-Change landing page to the home page and move the home page (index.js) to be called a shopping page
-Need to create a consistent brand identity (clothing & color scheme)- shopping cart uses clothing as an example, other pages use a construction site template
-Change photos from decking company to tiny home furnature company
-Create an about page

## Lessons Learned:

<!-- No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing. -->
